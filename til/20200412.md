# Today I Learned

## Bigquery

### Using FARM_FINGERPRINT()

We could use FARM_FINGERPRINT() to get the hash of a data from a column, and use it as reference to split the dataset. Maybe just take 1-3 first number of the hash to decide the split.

### Using DDL to create a view with description and meta

Using BQ DDL for setting the meta in the options of create/alter view/table so that the table/view description will be consistent.

### Linear Reg using MSE or RMSE, as Logistic Regression use ROC-AUC to evaluate the model
