### Standardization vs Normalization

after we calculate the current parameter of the data (e.g. min, max, mean, SD) when we add new data should we process it based on existing parameter of should we recalculate it?

### Feature Engineering

It should be used when model is underfitting. Why it works on underfitted model? when the data is actually not a *new* one?

### ETL Pipeline vs Pandas

When looking at the examples, it is clear that whan pandas have so many useful functions in preparing a data, ETL pipeline sometimes only use numpy so that it can process a stream of data (one record of pandas at a time as opposed to a whole data at a time). It will be useful when we're 'consuming' data rather than having a file containing a data already.
