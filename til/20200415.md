He goes on to explain why he thought that blog may broke the internet, citing [Amy Hoy article](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/). And also cite Tom Critchlow's [Building a Digital Garden ](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) Idea of non-performative blogging in our personal space on the web.

With that in minds, instead of letting a robot decide the order of article, we as the writer currate what we want to show to our audience.

### [On Buying vs Buiding](https://lethain.com/build-vs-buy/)

Sometimes it is impossible and not feasible to build everything that you need in a company. Thus to decide whether a system should be built or bought (from vendor) here are a simple rule of thumb to make a decision.

- Risk : risk of using the vendor whether when the vendor is building the system (vendor going bankrupt, shift in price) or after (security breach)
- Value : How much value the vendor could generate when compared to if the team handle it inhouse.
> a good advice: if [you're a technology company](https://lethain.com/tech-company/), vendors usually generate significant value if they're outside your company's core competency; within your core competency, they generally slow you down.
- Cost : Integration costs, FInancial costs, Operating costs, Evolution costs

> My rule of thumb is to first understand if there are any sufficiently high risks that you simply can't move forward. If the risks are acceptable, then perform a simple value versus cost calculation and accept the results!

Additional thoughts about vendor management. many companies are quite bad at vendor management, yet quite good at building things. To get full value from vendors, we need to also invest in managing vendors well (look at amazon)
