### Detecting Encoding

to detect encoding we could match it up with aliases in `encoding.aliases` or using `chardet` package to open the file first and detect its encoding

### Pandas Groupby result in a group name and group value
and we could work on each group by using transform. Which will apply the function to each group value (each series of a dataframe).

To fill in missing value of a grouped data we could simply do:
`df.groupby(column_name)[value_name].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean))`
here the x in lambda will refer to the value_name series of the grouped data.

### ? How to do data backfilling?

While it may not be relevant now, as what i want to do, it will be useful later down the road.

### [Feeding Camera Fake Video](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/)

Using [pyfakewebcam](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/) and [V4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) to fake our webcam device

while on the topic, try recreate realtime [bodypix](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) local inference server.

### [Malleable Systems](https://malleable.systems/)

Reminds me a lot about my Cooking x Programming post.
>The user wants open software, software that can be modified, and that can participate in a progressive improvement process.
>â€” J.C.R. Licklider, Some Reflections on Early History (1986)

#### The concept
1. Software must be as [easy to change](https://malleable.systems/mission/#1-easy-to-change) as it is to use it
2. All layers, from the user interface through functionality to the data within, must support [arbitrary recombination and reuse](https://malleable.systems/mission/#2-arbitrary-recombination-and-reuse) in new environments
3. Tools should strive to be easy to begin working with but still have lots of [open-ended potential](https://malleable.systems/mission/#2-arbitrary-recombination-and-reuse)
4. People of all experience levels must be able to [retain ownership and control](https://malleable.systems/mission/#4-retain-ownership-and-control)
5. Recombined workflows and experiences must be [freely sharable](https://malleable.systems/mission/#5-freely-sharable) with others
6. Modifying a system should happen in the [context of use](https://malleable.systems/mission/#6-modifying-in-the-context-of-use), rather than through some separate development toolchain and skill set
7. Computing should be a [thoughtfully crafted](https://malleable.systems/mission/#7-thoughtfully-crafted), fun, and empowering experience

### [Arguement for Mobile first to support responsive design](https://dev.to/kevinpowell/stop-making-responsive-websites-the-hard-way-kgb)

to empower it, start with typography, ie. `font-family`, `font-sizes` and `margin`. With that, it is a good enough mobile first website, you only need to add `pading` and `backdround`
